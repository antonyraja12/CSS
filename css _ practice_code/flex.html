            <p>A few years ago, when Rajiv Saini, one of Mumbai's most sought-after designers, came across a property on the lush banks of Tapti river, Surat, he knew the house had to speak to this crucial element of nature. “The river became the highlight of the apartment, and we planned the spaces so that the owners would maximise their time facing the river bank,” says Saini. In this private Surat apartment, which spans 4,500-square-feet, the blue of the Tapti washes in, engulfing the space in its calm and quiet. Shadows dance on the walls as the sun plays hide-and-seek on the water surface. After all, a home is—as Saini believes—more than just a refuge, or a place to sleep in. “It is meant to be an experience,” he says. And so, Saini put his friendship with Samir Mehta, a businessman who resides in Mumbai, on the forefront, and created a sanctuary—far from the madding crowd. Saini knew what he wanted the moment he set his eyes on the apartment. The house was already balance out this family home, Saini decided to go for the “visually light and a bit of fun”.</p>
